This repository contains a React + Electron client to consume the API at https://github.com/darkhorrow/example-business-java-api.

**Note**:

The Electron part is not expected to be resolved right now, existing only the React App at the moment.

The client presents an app to manage Items, Suppliers, Price Reductions, Users and Deactivations, allowing specific actions to user with/out admin role.

To start using it, run first the server side. Then, use the following commands to run  the client:

    cd react-app/
    yarn start
